README

1) Correctly Implemented: All the things. Saves data to local storage using key value pairs

2) Not Correctly Implemented: Hopefully Nothing!

Note) I probably coulda checked for null instead of automatically initiating log to an empty string but might go back and fix if I have time. This is only a problem if you clear local storage but dont refresh the page, just meaning first term is undefined

3) Worked with: Josh and Leona

4) Hours Spent: productively? 2-3.
