README

What I did: Took the code given for index.html and made a responsive.css file to choose the location I want on the sprite sheet, software.png. I used the software class to change the attribute of the image, like the height and width to fit the specific boxes, and the background-position to choose where the partial image will start on the sprite sheet. By calling media query @media screen I was able to choose what part of the image I wanted based on how big the screen was. Tested using local host 8000

What works: Hopefully everything!

What Doesnt: Hopefully nothing!
