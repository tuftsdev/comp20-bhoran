	<h1>Security - Assignment 4</h1>
	<h2> Introduction</h2>
		<p>I was hired as a security consultant, to look for weaknesses in a potentially vunerable web application. The application is a game and game server, specifically the game 2048. I was primarily focused on exploiting the server that holds the score information. There are three routes for the server, a GET index, GET scores.json and POST submit.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The GET /, or get index route, displays scores from my client's 2048 game at <a href="https://secret-oasis-38538.herokuapp.com">this url</a>, an app hosted by Heroku.</li>
			<li>The GET scores.json path allows the user to enter a query (username, score, or grid) in the website <a href="https://secret-oasis-38538.herokuapp.com/scores.json">URL</a> to get json information attached to that particular key</li>
			<li>The POST submit is how the scores are added to the server from the 2048 game. It adds information such as username, score, grid and time to a MongoDB database known as scores.</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Methodology</h2>
		<p>Describe your methodology pen testing the application, including the tools that you used
			1) Black Box Testing- I began with tests for simple things covered in class: XSS and insertation attacts in scores.json by using $ne. The XSS attack was sucessful, but the insertion was not
			2) White Box Testing- Looking into the code didnt provide any notable vunerabilities. In fact, it just explained why my previous attempt at insertion didnt work. The

	<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
		<p>Provide an overview of all the security and privacy issues you identified. This section should be written for non-technical managers who do not have technical expertise and do not have time to read the entire document. Write this section using lay language.</p>

	<h2>Issues Found</h2>
		<p>For each issue that you find, document:
			Issue (e.g., database injection, really bad programming practice)
			Location or page where issue was found
			Severity of issue (e.g., low, medium , or high). Justify your answer.
			Description of issue. How did you find it? A screenshot of problem is excellent.
			Proof of vulnerability. Show pictures or it didn't happen.
			Resolution. Make recommendation(s) on how issue can be resolved. Show code if possible.
			

			nosql
			we didnt use sql so not that
			xss
			hardcode credentials
			create json object in data
			sql getting data that youre not expected to
			expecting sting name but instead has another field to confuse mongo dn
			curl --data username={"$eq":"admin"}
			has to be username 
			dumping all data only works in scores .json bc that is where we are searching the database 
			scores.json?username[$ne]=

			trick username to be script tag
			curl --data "username=<script>alert("Brigid");</script>&score=2&grid={}

			curl --data "username=<script>alert("Brigid");</script>&score=79&grid={}" https://secret-oasis-38538.herokuapp.com/submit

			<p>You can also list future considerations and recommendations with costs.</p>
