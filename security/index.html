	<h1>Security - Assignment 4</h1>
	<h2> Introduction</h2>
		<p> Provide a description of the product and what you were hired to do</p>


		<p>XSS cross site scripting requires use of javascript not html, so not static content</p>
		<p>INjection attacks, more data then should have access to</p>
		<p> biggest vuneribilities when people hard code passwords and usernames, can see source code in any browser, just leaving keys in the car, also when hardcode something cant change it, when dealing with inbedded systems, wireless router cant change it</p>
		<p>cwe</p>
		<p>cross origin resource sharing- allow access origin sharing, key, value is *, wildcard, allowing any cite access to any site-- better to specify what sites to share between</p>
		<p> var mongu_uri = process.env.MONGODB, do "username:passwoed@mlab.com/2048gamecenter"</p>
		<p>never trust anythign from client Lab 2, hack me ec url in assignment 2 forms called hidden fields</p>
		<p>use a proxy, when a website's blocked, change the url so you can bypass the block
			requwst response between client and server
			instead of direct to server, send request to proxy middle man, proxy does all request for you, server sends response ot proxy, sends back to you
		</p>
		<p>once you have a web proxy can bypass any client side restrictions,Kali Linux</p>
		<p>no proxy, hack me comp 20</p>
		<p>burp-- free softward, suite, can do automated testing, Xss os injection and other security problems, paid version has auromated scanner, virtual machine runs local server at 8080 funnel all traffic to proxy</p>
		<p> in firefox, manual rroxy configuration, in firefox settings, instead of direct connection to server, goes to burp proxy, proxy intercepts all http headers, have coice to forward or drop the connectionurl format win http post, can change it in pro</p>
		<p> Ip adresses cant tell much, cant tell if youre using a proxy- IF a company is smart, shouldnt be happening, anything from client is shit</p>
