1) Stuff that works: Hopefully everything that needs to.

Get google maps api, show map with markers and red polyline, open info window with schedules for stops, info window with stop name and distance to closest in miles for the geolocation marker. Poly line drawn from geoloctaion, if allowed, to closest.

2) Stuff that doesn't work: I used Ming's link for the mbta api. I tried to get my own api key but was still getting some Cross Origin Resource blocking Errors. (I'm really hoping when you're grading this you aren't spamming the server bc if you are my info windows won't open and there will be errors... whoops. Refresh page)

3) Talked with: Ralfi and Juliana TAs, Josh, Leona, Ming
Used mings examples and google dev code as a reference

4) Hours Spent: like 20
