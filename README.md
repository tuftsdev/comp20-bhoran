This Git repository is a collection of labs and projects I completed in Web Programming.

My favorite assignment was the mbta T map, since it was the first project that I felt had an obvious practical use, and that I was able to try things on my own and have them work.

I think I have grown a fair amount. I have a better general understanding of the web and feel mildly better about computer science on the whole.

The most important things that I learned were to never trust client input and to ask questions. I'm still not good at asking questions but I try in my own way. 

I thought security was interesting, and the idea of having to plan and anticipate to avoid exploitation.
